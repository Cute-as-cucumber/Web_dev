                <p class = "homepage-description">Battleship is a strategy type guessing game
                     for two players. It is played on ruled grids on which 
                     each player's fleet of warships are marked. The locations of the fleets 
                     are concealed from the other player. Players alternate turns calling 
                     "shots" at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is 
                     to destroy the opposing player's fleet. Enjoy the game!
